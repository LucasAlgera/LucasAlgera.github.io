# Landscape Editor

JEDI fallen order, Borderlands, Black Myth Wukon and many more games have been made using the Unreal Engine. All these games have incredible landscapes and have most likely made use of Unreal's Landscaping tool. With many games becoming more complex and environments becoming bigger and more impressive it is almost a necessity for game engines to have a landscape sculpter of some sorts. With multiple other engines also having similar landscaping tools I thought it was an interesting project to try and recreate one in an Educational Engine supplied to me by my teachers. This assignment was part of my studies in **Creative Media and Game Technologies** at **Breda University of applied sciences**.

In this article I will share the knowledge I have gained having worked on and having researched landscape editors for 2 months in a game engine environment.
