<h2 id="week-1️⃣-self-study-plan">Week 1️⃣: Self-study plan</h2>

<p><em>Give an outline of your self-study plan. You don’t have to present the complete plan here (you’re already handing in the one-pager on Brightspace!), but just repeat the most important points.</em></p>

<p><em>Job title:</em> Senior Tools Programmer at Epic Games</p>

<p><em>Project title:</em> Terrain brushes for the Bee engine</p>

<p><em>Week 3 milestone:</em> Be able to “paint” on a surface and have that be saved to a greyscale png.</p>

<p><em>Week 5 milestone:</em> Upon loading in the terrain have the height of the polygons in the grid be dependent on the heightmap from the png using either just a bunch of planes or doing it the way the OpenGL article below instructs.</p>

<p><em>Week 7 milestone:</em> Optimize the brush so that real time editing of the terrain goes smoothly without lag and add a fitting UI that helps the user with the brush (brushsize, strength, etc.)</p>

<p><em>Stress tests:</em> I can increase the polycount in the terrain to test performance on high-level terrains. And I can test how big the brush can be (how many polygons will be updated at the same time). I will make use of the bee engine profiler for this.</p>

<p><em>Stretch goals:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Having the colour of the polygon be bound to the height of the polygons which can make for some cool mountain like effects.</li>
  <li>User defined shapes for brushes.</li>
  <li>Noise based brushes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="week-2️⃣-progress-meeting">Week 2️⃣: Progress meeting</h2>

<p><em>Make sure you can give a live demo of your project during the weekly meeting. Paste a screenshot/video here.</em> 
<img src="../assets/media/W1Showcase.png" alt="W1_Showcase" /></p>

<p><em>What have you been doing over the past week? How much time did it take?</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Made my self study plan.</li>
  <li>Researched terrain generation and terrain brushes in other engines.</li>
  <li>Researched terrain rendering.</li>
  <li>Made the bee engine compile and started working on a brush which saves to a .png.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>What problems/challenges (foreseen or unforeseen) did you run into?</em> <br />
I knew that getting the brush position and where it paints on the canvas and eventually saving that to a .png would take a bit of time but I eventually figured it out. What took some time was figuring out and better understanding the stb_image library. I still have to decide whether I want to save it as 8 or 16 bit.</p>

<p><em>What are you planning to do in the upcoming week?</em>   <br />
Visualize what you paint in the editor (I am thinking of something with ImGui) and better refine the brush by having it paint with a falloff, strength, etc.</p>

<p><em>Are you on track overall? Do you need to adjust your milestones / stress tests (either up or down)? If so, what are your new milestones / stress tests?</em>     <br />
I think as of now I am on track so I wont be changing any of my milestones. I will however add “Tri-planar mapping” as a stretch goal after talking to Bojan about my self-study plan.</p>

<p><em>Do you have any technical questions you need help with? If so, what are they?</em>   <br />
No.</p>

<p><em>Make sure you can give a live demo of your project during the weekly meeting. Paste a screenshot/video here.</em></p>

<p><img src="../assets/media/W3_TexturePainting.png" alt="W3 Texture" /></p>

<p><em>What have you been doing over the past week? How much time did it take?</em>
This past week i’ve been buisy with adding texture drawing for the heightmaps. I have also been researching the rendering aspect of the terrain more.</p>

<p><em>What problems/challenges (foreseen or unforeseen) did you run into?</em>
It took a bit of trial and error to get the texture drawing working but eventually i got there. 
I am totally not familiar with rendering yet and I will have to spend a lot of time trying to get that working in my project.</p>

<p><em>What are you planning to do in the upcoming week?</em>
Get a grid of triangles to be drawn according to the heightmap put in by the user.</p>

<p><em>Are you on track overall? Do you need to adjust your milestones / stress tests (either up or down)? If so, what are your new milestones / stress tests?</em>
I have put the “User defined brushes” stretchgoal to the week 3 milestone. But I feel like I am on track.</p>

<p><em>Do you have any technical questions you need help with? If so, what are they?</em>
No.</p>

<p><em>Make sure you can give a live demo of your project during the weekly meeting. Paste a screenshot/video here.</em></p>

<p><img src="../assets/media/W4_Progress.png" alt="W4 terrainGen" /></p>

<p><em>What have you been doing over the past week? How much time did it take?</em>
Last week I have been trying to get some rendering working and trying to get a better understanding of how OpenGL and glsl work. 
…</p>

<p><em>What problems/challenges (foreseen or unforeseen) did you run into?</em>
Me having a hard time getting textures to work in shaders. 
…</p>

<p><em>What are you planning to do in the upcoming week?</em>
Getting the heightmap to render the right way, maybe with textures. 
…</p>

<p><em>Are you on track overall? Do you need to adjust your milestones / stress tests (either up or down)? If so, what are your new milestones / stress tests?</em>
I think so? I feel like i am behind because the rendering takes me quite long but I am still somewhat on track i believe.

<p><em>Make sure you can give a live demo of your project during the weekly meeting. Paste a screenshot/video here.</em></p>

<p><img src="../assets/media/workingTerrainGen.gif" alt="W5 terrainGen" /></p>

<p><em>What have you been doing over the past week? How much time did it take?</em></p>

<p>I have been working on getting the rendering working, this took me a bit long to understand because I was very unfamiliar with the way BEE handles it’s rendering. 
Right now my code is just kind of chucked into the rendering loop, I would like to eventually put this into my own files. I have also fixed some small brush regarding bugs i still had.</p>

<p><em>What problems/challenges (foreseen or unforeseen) did you run into?</em></p>

<p>That getting the heightmap into the vertex shader would take so much time. I tried to go with the way BEE handles it but it was quite a task.</p>

<p><em>What are you planning to do in the upcoming week?</em></p>

<p>Getting normal calculation and some texturing.</p>

<p><em>Are you on track overall? Do you need to adjust your milestones / stress tests (either up or down)? If so, what are your new milestones / stress tests?</em>
Yes.</p>

<p><em>Do you have any technical questions you need help with? If so, what are they?</em></p>

<p>…</p>

<h2 id="week-6️⃣-progress-meeting">Week 6️⃣: Progress meeting</h2>

<p><em>Make sure you can give a live demo of your project during the weekly meeting. Paste a screenshot/video here.</em> 
In the image below I show that i am working on my normal generation. There is something happening but all the normals are mirrored and there is a huge artifact which covers half of the terrain. 
<img src="../assets/media/W6_WrongNormals.png" alt="W6 Wrong normals" /></p>

<p><em>What have you been doing over the past week? How much time did it take?</em>
I have spent a lot of time getting back into it after the vacation and generating normals for my heightmap. Generating the normals took most of my week because of an issue I have explained below.</p>

<p><em>What problems/challenges (foreseen or unforeseen) did you run into?</em>
What took me a really long time was generating the normals correctly, this was partly because I did not yet understand the math behind it well enough and it took me a really long time to figure out that the max mesh size for bee was 255x255. Before I tried it with a higher subdivision count but then the uint16_t which stored the normals, which has a max value of 65535, would overflow at a certain point which would mess up the normals. At first I thought it had something to do with the UV’s not being correct and there being something wrong in my generation, so I spent a long time looking in the wrong place.</p>

<p><em>What are you planning to do in the upcoming week?</em>
I got the feedback from Bert that i should spend more of my time actually building the right things which makes a good tool. Brushes that can actually make mountains, good mouse-mountain interseciton, etc.
I will also rework a bit of my system so i can load in and render more than 1 heightmap at a time by doing some sort of heightmap ID system. 
I will also start with the optimization of my tool by finding hotspots in my code.</p>

<p><em>Are you on track overall? Do you need to adjust your milestones / stress tests (either up or down)? If so, what are your new milestones / stress tests?</em> 
My week 7 milestone was: Optimize the brush so that real time editing of the terrain goes smoothly without lag and add a fitting UI that helps the user with the brush (brushsize, strength, etc.). I will also be updating my stresstest from amount of subdivisions to how many times per frame we can update the normals.</p>

<p>I will change this to: Optimize the brush so that real time editing of the terrain goes smoothly without lag and add multiple brushes such as smoothing, falloff, etc. Start with making my API a bit cleaner and user friendly.</p>

<p><em>Do you have any technical questions you need help with? If so, what are they?</em>
No.</p>

<h2 id="week-7️⃣-progress-meeting">Week 7️⃣: Progress meeting</h2>

<p><em>Make sure you can give a live demo of your project during the weekly meeting. Paste a screenshot/video here.</em> 
Here you can see that I fixed all the normals and I am able to load and render multiple heightmaps. 
<img src="../assets/media/W7_progress.png" alt="W7 Progress" /></p>

<p><em>What have you been doing over the past week? How much time did it take?</em>
This week I have spent time on making a smoothing and a falloff brush, so the “mountain making” part of the tool is now working. I have also redone a bit of my code so that I can render more than 1 heightmap at a time. Before I only stored 1 heightmap which was the one you were working on. But now I store multiple and I link them together by using a HeightMapID variable where upon creation of a landscape the heightmap and the terrain entity get connected to each other.</p>

<p><em>What problems/challenges (foreseen or unforeseen) did you run into?</em>
Not a whole lot this week. Some small stuff but not like last week where it held up a lot of my progress.</p>

<p><em>What are you planning to do in the upcoming week?</em>
Next week I want to have my entire tool finished on Tuesday so it’s done before the showcase. What I want to do is change the raycasting I have right now to work on mountains instead of just the groundplane. I also want to clean up my API and make it more user friendly and optimize the painting process.</p>

<p><em>Are you on track overall? Do you need to adjust your milestones / stress tests (either up or down)? If so, what are your new milestones / stress tests?</em>
Yes, everything I want to do is in the milestone I reset in week 6.</p>

<p><em>Do you have any technical questions you need help with? If so, what are they?</em>
No</p>
