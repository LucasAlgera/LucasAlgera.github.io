      <p>As a game (engine) programmer, <strong>I can create a technically impressive production-ready tool / feature</strong>, so that my work can help shape future projects.</p>

<h1 id="-detailed-rubric">💯 Detailed Rubric</h1>

<p>🔴 <strong>Poor:</strong> Evidence of some development work in line with the self-study plan. The student has written enough code themselves.</p>

<p>In ILO 1 I have constantly kept up with my self-study plan and when I had to change things I would always announce that in that weeks ILO part. And eventually my tool came out like I expected. Terrain Brushes and Terrain Sculpting in the BEE engine.</p>

<p><em>Week 3 milestone:</em> Be able to “paint” on a surface and have that be saved to a greyscale png.</p>

<p><em>Week 5 milestone:</em> Upon loading in the terrain have the height of the polygons in the grid be dependent on the heightmap from the png using either just a bunch of planes or doing it the way the OpenGL article below instructs.</p>

<p><em>Week 7 milestone:</em> Optimize the brush so that real time editing of the terrain goes smoothly without lag and add a fitting UI that helps the user with the brush (brushsize, strength, etc.)</p>

<video width="320" height="240" controls="">
  <source src="../assets/media/ToolShowcase.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<p>In this video I show that I have achieved all the milestones I had set for myself. I have the grayscale painting with different types of brushes: circle, falloff, texture brush and smoothing brush. I have the terrain rendering which is being done by offsetting vertices of a grid by sampling over a heightmap in a shader. I have added UI which the user can use to tweak brush settings, see the heightmap they are drawing on and a small manager where you can load more heightmaps from disk.</p>

<p>🟠 <strong>Insufficient:</strong> Evidence of the project output being a usable tool/feature. Videos and code examples show the project’s basic usage and capabilities.</p>

<p>With 1 simple line of code the user can add a landscape to the engine: 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Engine.TerrainManager().AddTerrain("Terrain1", "assets/textures/HeightMap1.png", 255, false);</code></p>

<p>The first paramater represents the name, second is the filepath of the heightmap you want to load, 3rd is the amount of subdivisions and last is a boolean if you want to load an empty terrain.</p>

<p>In the video above I have already showcased most of the tool’s features.</p>

<p>🟡 <strong>Sufficient:</strong> Evidence of the project output having all the functionality mentioned in the self-study plan, for example by showing multiple demos. The work has been sufficiently complex.</p>

<p>🟢 <strong>Good:</strong> Evidence of the tool/feature being easy to embed into other projects, using well-designed APIs and clear examples of usage. Evidence shows good technical execution in terms of software architecture, algorithms, data structures, error handling, etc.</p>

<p>🔵 <strong>Excellent:</strong> Videos and other evidence show that the student’s code is robust and well-tested. The student has significantly pushed the boundaries of the project, by investigating and solving complex domain problems on their own.</p>
